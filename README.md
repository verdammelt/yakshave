Yak Shaving crossed with Not Invented Here Syndrome.

Full web app in Common Lisp only. Only given is SBCL. Everything else
written here. 

SBCL gives me threads & sockets.

I'll need to write:

* testing framework
* HTTP parsing
* web server
* Lisp->HTML compiler?
* Lisp->JS compiler?
* Heroku buildpack?

Todo:

* Need a better name
* Need an actual feature to implement
** blog?
** weight tracking?
